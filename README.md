# Use instructions

**1. General use**
You can move the map by dragging it with mouse and zoom in or out by using the mouse wheel or the (+) (-) icons on the right. House icon returns the map to the default extent. The right panel shows information of selected data, and you can move from info panel to another with the arrows on the panel’s top corners.

**2. Selecting community or property**
The default selecting technique is select by point so just by clicking the map you can select specific content to view. You can also choose a different selecting technique by clicking the three lines icon from upper left corner and activating “select”. A panel appears to the right where you can choose your selecting technique and after that start selecting communities or properties from the map. 

**3. Search**
You can search a specific community or address by using the search bar on the upper left corner. The map automatically zooms into the searched point or area.

**4. Layers**
From the info panel’s “Layer List” sections you can alter which of the three layers you want to show on the map. You can also change the layers transparency and order on the map by clicking the three-dot icon next to the layers name and choosing the desired action.
